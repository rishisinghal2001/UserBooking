# UserBooking
•	This document explains what I have learned as my internship. In this document I will summarize about an application User Booking which is created using Spring Boot.
•	In this project I created endpoints from where we can create a guest, update and delete and a guest can book reservation in a train. And guest can check its booking using REST APIs.
•	As a part of this project, I also integrated spring-doc open api which generates human understandable api-documentation for this spring boot project.
•	In last we Integrate a solution for migration from swagger to open-api.
